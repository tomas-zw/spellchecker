# spellchecker

A small cli that builds a Trie from a text file with 25k words.

- Check if a word exists
- Search for a word (shows up to 10 words based on frequency)
- Change dictionary
- Print all words (merge sort)
- Remove a word

To run the cli, build the container and run it with the -it flag.
